# Modern frontend and backend template

This template provides a modern single-page application for starting build-environment easier.

## Installation

Setup is so easy, because I accept a monorepo environment.

1. Install package dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

2. Run a frontend using vite

```
yarn dev
```

3. Open new terminal and run a backend with NestJS

```
yarn server
```
