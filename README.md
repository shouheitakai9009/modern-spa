# Modern frontend and backend template

This template provides a modern single-page application for starting build-environment easier.

## Installation

Setup is so easy, because I accept a monorepo environment.

1. Install package dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

2. Run a modern single-page application

```
yarn dev
```
